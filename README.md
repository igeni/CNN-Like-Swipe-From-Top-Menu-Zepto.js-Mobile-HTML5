This is an example prepared to show off a type of sliding drawer menu similar to CNN's iPhone app, but using HTML5 Hybrid approach with Javascript, CSS3, and Zepto.js. Paired with PhoneGap its a great menu treatment technique.

Note: A real demo of this requires compiling this to a Hybrid app using PhoneGap Build with UIWebView bounce turned off. I have included a config.xml starter file for these purpose.

Install it on iOS from Phonegap Build by scanning this QR:
